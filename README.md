# GrnHouse120
Arduino Controlled GreenHouse project.
This project run by Steve Hoyt and Al Borsodi involves a new greenhouse that Steve has setup with laptops monitoring several growing beds with lights and Arduino controlled lights and watering with Arduino monitors for temperature, light, and soil moisture.  The laptops are used for remote control and monitoring via TCPIP.
Al is obtaining a FarmBot that he will prototype in his home before commiting it to the greenhouse later this spring.
